## QualApps’ ADPQ Submission
QualApps is thankful for the opportunity to submit a rsponse to RFI# CDT–PQVP–0118.  In a short timeframe, QualApps mobilized a multi-disciplinary team to review this RFI and rapidly respond. We are pleased with the outcome and hope that the Department of Technollogy is equally pleased with our Working Prototype and Technical Approach.

## QualApps’s Approach to Building the Working Prototype
QualApps convened a multidisciplinary team of highly experienced Information Technology (IT) professionals from within our internal staffing network to work on this Prototype. Everyone on our team is currently working on other projects, and our team members have worked with one another. This allowed us to coalesce quickly as a team and assign work based on each team member’s strengths. 

The team adopted a Scrum-based approach to development and identified the high level scope necessary to meet the Minimal Value Plan (MVP) for the Working Prototype in a compressed, two-week time frame. Sprint planning included translating the MVP into two epics, creating high level user stories and determining how the Prototype architecture and infrastructure would be built to support the Prototype plan. Our technical team chose modern tools and techniques with which they were already familiar reducing ramp up time. The team determined that the work could be completed during two sprints over 10 days (five days per sprint). This Planning effort was completed within two days of receipt of the RFI and development began immediately.

Roles and responsibilities
Given the compressed timeframe of this effort, the team organized the work around three separate sprints:
Sprint Zero
Sprint 1
Sprint 2

## Conformance to the US Digital Services Playbook
At the beginning of the project, for each Play the team went through each item on the checklist and reviewed and answered key questions. We found that the questions were particularly helpful in establishing a context for product development and sparking ideas about Epics and User Stories.  We made use of the checklists although in some cases the project's short timeframe made them impracticable.  For example, we did not have sufficient time to use metrics to determine how well we met user needs (Play 1) or establish and manage to a budget (Play 5).  

Below, we outline how we addressed each Play in the Playbook We provide a brief narrative explaining how we addressed questions, and then a checkbox for each item in the checklist that we completed. For brevity, we sometimes abbreviate or summarize checklist items. 

**Play 1 Understand what people need**

Regarding Key Questions: We considered (based on the RFI) that the primary users are State departments and agencies.  We thought about various applications for a knowledge sharing platform.  For example, we considered tailoring it to assist with workforce development, in particular providing a platform wherein seasoned employees and millennials could collaborate on knowledge transfer.  Another consideration was developing a knowledge-sharing platform for trouble-shooting technical issues.  In the end, we decided we could develop a feature-rich platform that would support any subject area, which could be tagged by topics. Questions helped us establish our initial backlog, e.g., "As a user I want to be able to search knowledge based on key-words/topics".  

- [x] Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users of the service
- [x] Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods (This was done minimally; see survey.)
- [x] Test prototypes of solutions with real people
- [x] As the digital service is being built, regularly test it

**Play 2 Address the whole experience, from start to finish**

The team discussed the key questions for Play 2 and identified a number of common issues with knowledge-sharing platforms.  Chief among these concerns was the ability to quickly identify information that is pertinent to a user.  This discussion led to user stories supporting knowledge organization and effective use of labels. Other items discussed were mechanisms to notify users via multiple channels when a discussion thread they subscribed to was updated.  

We discussed a couple of metrics for ways in which we could evaluate the effectiveness of the DAAS solution: after interacting with the solution over a period of time, For a list of up to six features, e.g., ability to add knowledge, modify existing knowledge artifact, comment on an artifact, find answers to questions, users would be asked to rank satisfaction with the platform by selecting up to five stars.  

**Play 3 Make it simple and intuitive**

**Play 4 Build the service using agile and iterative practices**

**Play 5 Structure budgets and contracts to support delivery**

**Play 6 Assign one leader and hold that person accountable**

**Play 7 Bring in experienced teams**

**Play 8 Choose a modern technology stack**

**Play 9 Deploy in a flexible hosting environment**

**Play 10 Automate testing and deployments**

**Play 11 Manage security and privacy through reusable processes**

**Play 12 Use data to drive decisions**

**Play 13 Default to open**


## RFI Requirements 
The README.md file should also make reference to the following:

**Requirement A: Assigned one (1) leader and gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted;**

**Requirement B: Assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes, at a minimum, five (5) of the labor categories as identified in Attachment B: PQVP AD-DS Labor Category Descriptions;**

Labor Category 1. Product Manager - 

Labor Category 2. Technical Architect - 

Labor Category 3. Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester - 

Labor Category 4. Writer/Content Designer/Content Strategist –

Labor Category 6. Front End Web Developer - 

Labor Category 7. Backend Web Developer – 

Labor Category 8. DevOps Engineer – 

Labor Category 9. Security Engineer - 

Labor Category 10. Delivery Manager – 

Labor Category 11. Agile Coach – 

Labor Category 12. Business Analyst – 

**Requirement C: Understood what people needed, by including people in the prototype development and design process;** 
The QualApps Project Director and Agile Coach reviewed the working prototype statement from the RFI to better understand and deconstruct the requirements of the prototype into epics. The QualApps Project Director coalesced a team of technical professionals to discuss how the identified epics would be architected based on the RFI requirements for simplicity, ease of use and open source.

The QualApps Project Director added additional analyst resources to the Scrum team to work with Izzie in establishing end user stories defining emergency and non-emergency notification needs.

The QualApps Researcher and Business analyst conducted internet-based research on the concepts for establishing an emergency notification network looking at the business needs of the individuals requesting notification as well as the technologies supporting such systems. Additional questions resulted from this research were posed to the end user to refine user stories and establish acceptance criteria.

vi.	A project was created in Jira  and the epics and user stories were added.
vii.	The QualApps team reviewed and prioritized user stories and determined the design of the prototype using agreed upon technologies.
viii.	Using the minimal viable product (MVP) approach, the Product Manager identified user stories belonging in backlog and assigned work to the team based on the most critical elements needed to provide a working prototype.
ix.	Once the prototype was tangible enough to produce a response, the team, including the end user, implemented role play. This included testing within our team in order to gain realistic and effective feedback for improvements.
x.	After receiving prototype feedback based on the role play, the team began integrating the feedback into the backlog as part of the next iteration of the prototype. Some of the identified user stories were created as icebox items to demonstrate that we are taking a MVP approach.

**Requirement D: Used at least a minimum of three (3) “user-centric design” techniques and/or tools**

**Requirement E: Used GitHub to document code commits**

**Requirement F: Used Swagger to document the RESTful API, and provided a link to the Swagger API**

**Requirement G: Complied with Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act and WCAG 2.0**

**Requirement H: Created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library**
