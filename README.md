QualApps’s Approach to Building the Working Prototype
QualApps convened a multidisciplinary team of highly experienced Information Technology (IT) professionals from within our internal staffing network to work on this Prototype. Everyone on our team is currently working on other projects, and our team members have worked with one another. This allowed us to coalesce quickly as a team and assign work based on each team member’s strengths.

### AThe team adopted a Scrum-based approach to development and identified the high level scope necessary to meet the Minimal Value Plan (MVP) for the Working Prototype in a compressed, two-week time frame. Sprint planning included translating the MVP into two epics, creating high level user stories and determining how the Prototype architecture and infrastructure would be built to support the Prototype plan. Our technical team chose modern tools and techniques with which they were already familiar reducing ramp up time. The team determined that the work could be completed during two sprints over 10 days (five days per sprint). This Planning effort was completed within two days of receipt of the RFI and development began immediately.
